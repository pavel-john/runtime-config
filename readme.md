# Client-side runtime config
Sample project demonstrating how to access configuration and environment variables in browser on runtime.

## Usage
- Navigate to root directory.
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `npm start`

## Environment
This is built with
- Ubuntu 18.0.4
- Node v10.9.0
- npm 6.7.0

I suppose it would work on similar unix-like setups too.
